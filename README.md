# IT100-Group-Project

## Group 5 Art Gallery
 
This repository is developed by group 5 in an IT100 class for our final project. The aim is to create a website that is accessible for all and allows people to submit their art as well as view historical art that is in the public domain. 

Our group members are Niko Swett, Sam O'Neal, Ryder Dettloff, and Bryte DeGroot.
